# nachonet
This was an undergrad project that aimed at setting up a Raspberry Pi based WiFi localization system
that would form the foundation of a drone-based nacho delivery system.

I will revisit this one day. For now it stands as a monument to my dream of a future world, a better
world, a world with more nachos...

Also, I'm not particularly happy with much in this project beyond the idea.
